# 🔍 Search Engine Project

A basic search engine web application built with **Java Servlets**, **JSP**, and **MySQL**. This app allows users to search for keywords and returns a list of relevant pages ranked by keyword frequency. It also logs every search query in a **search history table**, and uses **Depth-First Search (DFS)** to crawl or traverse through website links and collect content.
